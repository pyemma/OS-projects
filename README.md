OS-projects
===========

This contains my OS lab projects. All of the lab is on linux. The first lab is to write a module to print all process's information, like PID, Name and Status. The second lab is to wirte another module to find a specific process's children and siblings. Lab 3 is to compile and install a new kernel and add a system call to print my name. Lab 4 is to add a patch add block all of the information of a specific user. The last lab is about system OI and we are asked to read and write all of the information of the process to a file under proc.
